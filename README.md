In this lab exercise, we work on the problem of predicting a buy or sell signal for a trading strategy in the classification framework. The predicted variable has a value of 1 for buy and 0 for sell. The buy or sell signal are decided on the basis on the comparison of short term vs. long term price.
The goal of this case study is tu use classification based models to predict whether the current signal is **buy or sell** depending on the short term vs long term price.
